# Building a Movie Recommendation  System with Deployment
I successfully implemented a hybrid recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering, benefiting from the strengths of both approaches for a more robust and accurate recommendation system.

# Data Collection

The project involved web scraping to gather information on over 5000+ movies, including details like genre, IMDb ratings, directors, runtime, and release years from https://justwatch.com

- IMDb API was used to fill missing information in different streaming platforms.


## Installation

Install my-project with streamit

    
## Deployment
